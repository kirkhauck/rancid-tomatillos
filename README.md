- [Deployed Site](https://rancid-tomatillos-lf1afsrp9-kirkhauck.vercel.app/)

## Abstract

Rancid Tomatillos is an app mimicking a movie database, created using React. Upon first visiting the site, the user is presented with a collection of movie images with basic stats such as release date, runtime, and average rating. The user can click any movie and be taken to a new page featuring more detailed information about the movie.

### Wins + Challenges:

**Win:**

Successfully learned how use React components to render a stateful, functional app.

**Win:**

Successfully utilized GET and POST to use data from a remote API.

**Challenge:**

Implementing a dynamic URL presented the largest challenge for us. We were able to arrive at solution by using `render` to pass down the `match` object to `SingleMovieContainer` and use `match.params.id` to match a single movie's id (also used as its URL end path) to dynamically render a single movie's details page.

**Challenge:**

Making multiple `MovieCard` components from the API data was a challenge. We arrived at a solution by passing all the API data via props to `MoviesContainer` and using the `.map()` array prototype method to return single `MovieCard` components.
